# Branding

Short notes about branding strategies for seagull following the
"LEAN Branding" framework.

## Name

* "Seagull" -> "Seagull Framework"
* symbolizes being "featherweight", "far reaching" and "cloud-y"
* (hidden) relation to the local environment at the (baltic) sea
* early sailors noticed seagulls right before they spotted land

## Positioning

Clarifying how customers will come from A (present) to B (desired future) through the product. Using a simple yet effective template:

**For** (_target customer_):

* Developers and Entrepreneurs

**Who** (_statement of the need or opportunity_):

* want to build digital products quickly using the LEAN approach

**The** (_product name_ is a _product category_):

* Seagull Framework is a Fullstack Web Framework

**That** (_key benefit/compelling reason to buy_):

* bootstraps a full-blown web app with feedback loops and serverless deployment

**Unlike** (_primary competitive advantage_):

* simpler frameworks which only provide some frontend and/or backend helpers

**Our Product** (_statement of primary differentiation_):

* guides developers from idea to launch to scaling up and far beyond

## Promise

**launch your idea today**:

* from idea to prototype within hours
* deployment is a non-event
* don't think about servers at all!

## Personas

Three stereotypical fictional customers, handpicked from out target audience.
They don't actually "buy a product" when choosing some technology, but have to invest time for learning and experimenting before actually becoming productive and building things.

### John

* **who he is**: 27 years old software developer for a company earning a high salary, has university degree for something related to computer science. Is married with children.
* **his pains**: being the most competent person around with no chance to actually challenge himself. The next career move would be management but this would be too mentally crippling.
* **his aspirations**: just starting his own business, without pointy-haired bosses forcing him to do stupid things. Can build software quickly, but often gets sidetracked in small technical bikeshedding leading to project abandonment.
* **his ToDos**: must build software and features for other people (customers, bosses) as fast and cheap as possible.
* **why he buys**: frameworks which have a small learning curve and are flexible enough to be customized for typical daily assignments without too much pain.
* **how to reach him**: specific technology blogs, hackernews and career network portals.

### Gary

* **who he is**: 32 years old serial entrepreneur with educational background in business. Has a wife but no children. Attends to lots of network events and has many contacts to important people.
* **his pains**: can't build the loads of ideas he collected over the years because building software and scaling stuff is such a costly hassle every time. He can only test the very best ideas he has, mostly just one, ever.
* **his aspirations**: being able to do things on his own. everything. ideally without much manual labor but with productive tooling ("work smarter, not harder").
* **his ToDos**: knowing people, realize new ideas and trying to turn a profit.
* **why he buys**: whatever helps him being more productive and frees up time.
* **how to reach him**: conferences, meetups, mailinglists and producthunt.

### Oscar

* **who he is**: 22 years old digital nomad running his own lifestyle business, with shallow self-taught programming skills. Is not married and travels all around the world while coding small projects to earn money.
* **his pains**: deploying stuff on servers does cost serious money, so he often does PHP to get really cheap hosting options. never had access to proper software architecture knowledge, so scaling things is a really hard task mentally.
* **his aspirations**: already living his dream, but wants to settle down somewhere finally and maybe start a family. this requires a much higher, steady income than being a nomad.
* **his ToDos**: producing fresh content and small web projects every day to earn income.
* **why he buys**: only buys things if he really needs to, and preferably things he can use for a long time and with immediate results.
* **how to reach him**: twitter, instagram, blogs, online advertising.

## Personality

choosing 6 traits from the adjectives list:

* **boundless**: infinite scale and reach for your products
* **charming**: usage/handling of seagull is really nice
* **helpful**: defaults and explanations to teach LEAN principles
* **modern**: discover new lands of web development (cloud age!)
* **productive**: scaffolding + structure for fast launchable products
* **shrewd**: outperform big players with years of experience in hours

## Product

simplified customer journey maps

* **before purchase** (_why this and not others?_): if you know javascript and react, you can ship your idea today into production. No need for learning strange languages or researching hosting options or setting up your domain with HTTPS. You will start collecting feedback while other might still setting basic things up.
* **during purchase** (_can this be made easier?_): if you have node.js installed, seagull is just an `npm install` away. also, it's free.
* **after purchase** (_has he made the right decision?_): enlight the user within a few minutes! the feeling of self-accomplishment is really needed.

## Pricing

seagull is and always will be free
